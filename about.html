<p class="dropcap">Here's the part where I tell you all about myself, and that's not something that comes easily. Not that I suffer from debilitaging shyness or anything, I'm just not the type to toot my own horn. So where to start?</p>
<p>I'm a developer with Gannett, the newspaper company most famous for publishing USA Today. I've been in the newspaper industry since graduating from Iowa State University with a degree in journalism in ::mumble mumble mumble::, but getting to "developer" took a somewhat circuitous route.</p>
<p><em>I don't want your life story. Just <a href="#tldr" style="color: var(--site-color, #a00)">skip to the end</a>.</em></p>
<p>I started out as a copy editor at the Omaha World-Herald.  This was before everybody had a personal computer, but it was definitely somethingo on the rise and something I thought I should check out. So I moseyed on over to the Nebraska Furniture Mart's electronics store and came away with a Macintosh Quadra 610 &mdash; 25 MHz of screaming power with a 230 MB hard drive and an inexhaustible 64 MB or RAM, all pumping thousands of colors to an expansive 14-inch CRT monitor.</p>
<h3>The arts beckon</h3>
<p>I was friends with the graphic artists at work, and they "loaned" me the installer disks for Adobe Photoshop and Aldus FreeHand. I spent many a long night running through tutorials in books like The Photoshop Bible and decided computer graphics were a lot more fun than catching subject-verb agreement errors and misplaced apostrophes. I moved to the graphics department and started building maps and bar charts, color-correcting photos and registering color separations on pages for the camera.</p>
<p>After a few years of that, I moved to Lexington, Ky., (followed my future wife down there) and spent a couple of years at a small marketing firm honing my Photoshop and Quark Xpress skills while waiting for a job to open up at the local newspaper. An opening did eventually happen, and I joined the graphics department of the Lexington Herald-Leader.</p>
<h3>My old Kentucky home</h3>
<p>The Herald-Leader was great in that I got to do a little bit of everything: photo illustrations, news graphics, 3-D renderings, pencil sketches. It's where I really cut my teeth on the trade.</p>
<p>Lexintgon was great, too. I really liked the city. It was just the perfect size with lots of golf courses and hiking trails and good restaurants. The one thing it didn't have was a reputation for great schools, something that became important with a 4-year-old and 1-year-old underfoot. You know who did have a great reputation for eduction? My home state of Iowa. So in 2004, I sent a resume to the Des Moines Register, the newspaper I grew up reading, the newspaper that inspired me to study journalism at Iowa State, and lo and behold, I was hired.</p>
<p>The graphics department had four other artists, so it took me some time to carve out my niche there. There was Mark, a world class illustrator, and Katie, a wonderful designer, and Kelli, a wizard at organizing and researching a project, and ... shoot, I can't remember his name, but he was the 3-D illustration guy. Part of the reason I can't remember his name is he left just a few months after I joined, which turned out to be fortunate for me, because I claimed the role of 3-D illustrator. Check out the <a href={{ "/graphics/" | relative_url }}>graphics</a> and <a href={{ "/illustrations/" | relative_url }}>illustrations</a> pages for a sample of my 3-D work.</p>
<h3>The digital frontier</h3>
<p>All of this was about the time the Internet was really starting to cut into the print business, so there was a push to put our work on the web. For us, that meant interactive graphics, and interactive graphics meant Flash. (Just typing the work still makes me shudder.) One of the things I had done when I bought that Quadra 610 was dabble in programming. I learned the C language, dabbled a bit in game programming, and even bought a couple of volumes of Inside Macintosh, the official Apple developer documentation. With that background, Flash and it's scripting language, ActionScript, was a breeze to pick up, and so my transtion from graphic artist to developer had begun.</p>
<p>Flash had it's pros and cons &mdash; lots of cons &mdash; but it was relatively easy to produce engaging interactive graphics in the deadline-intensive environment of a daily newspaper. I did my share of games and quizzes but also a few larger scale projects of which I remain proud to this day: On the 50th anniversary of Buddy Holly's death near Clear Lake, Iowa, we published a project that made heavy use of Flash; and when a tornado decimated Parkersburg, Iowa, we built a map that showed the extent of the destruction with before and after photos and survivors' testimony.</p>
<p>As I gained experience building interactive graphics, I worked on more data-driven graphics, stuff like election results, economic indicators, high school sports tournament results, etc. Out of that grew a need for me to learn some of the backend technology that stored and served up the data. The Register's website, and a few subsites built on WordPress, ran on PHP backed by MySQL databases, so I quickly picked those up. Where there's data, there's a want to manage that data, so I learned how to build admin dashboards for editors to access. For that I honed my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript and frameworks like jQuery and Backbone. It's also where I developed my affinity for building dashboards.</p>
<h3>A quasi-career change</h3>
<p>As more of my workload became developer-centric, I moved from the Register's graphics department to the dev team. About this time, the newspaper industry was undergoing tremendous upheaval as subscriptions and ad revenue continued to decline. Gannett's reaction was consolidate duties wherever it could, and not long after my move, it decided local development teams were a luxury, and I was moved into a regional team.</p>
<p>As part of the Local Digital Soulutions Network, I still worked on projects for the Register but also stuff for other newspapers. In learning to develop for Presto, Gannett's company-wide content management system (CMS), I learned Node.js, Epxress and Angular. I put that knowledge to work building Pressbox, an internal analytics dashboard for Gannett reporters, and as a lead developer on <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/border-wall/" style="color: var(--site-color, #a00)">The Wall</a>, a Pulitzer Prize-winning project reporting on the U.S.-Mexico border fence.</p>
<p>Based on that work, I was offered a position in Gannett's Storytelling Studio, which is where I am today. Our purpose is to break new ground in digital storytelling, finding unique and original ways of engaging readers. I take text, images, video, audio, maps, charts, 3-d models, VR, AR &mdash; everything is in our toolbox &mdash; and dream up new approaches to presenting the news and compelling human interest stories.</p>
<p>One of the perks of trying new things: I routinely get to sink my teeth into new frameworks and languages. Since joining the team, I've particularly enjoyed working with golang and the VueJS and Svelte javascript frameworks.</p>
<p>I plan to use the <a href={{ "/blog/" | relative_url }}>blog section</a> to share what I've learned, sometimes as I'm learning it. Thanks for reading this far. Be sure to check back.</p>
<p id="tldr" class="tldr"><strong>tl;dr</strong> I studied journalism in college, started out as a newspaper copy editor, switched to the graphics department, picked up Flash, then became a web developer for Gannett.</p>
