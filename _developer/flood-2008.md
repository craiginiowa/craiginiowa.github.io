# 2008 Flood

In 2008, massive flooding in eastern Iowa sent rivers over of their banks, flooding several cities. Cedar Rapids was hit particularly hard, and for the 10-year anniversary of the flood, I build this page offering a timeline of the flooding and PDFs of Des Moines River front pages with headlines documenting the destruction. Pardon the latin placeholders in the links section under the headline and intro text â€” I don't have a complete screen capture, and the page is no longer live on the Register's site.
