# Scrolly Topper

Much of what I do now in my role at Gannett is in support of our "in-depth" framework, which gives designers the tools to create an engaging and unique presentation on a story-by-story basis. This particular bit of bling is something we call a scrolly topper. The first iteration was an image with s headline and sub-headline, then blocks of text scrolling over it before transitioning into the main story. It's since grown to accept multiple images and various style and position options for the headlines and slide text. Check out the linked story to get a better idea of what it is.
