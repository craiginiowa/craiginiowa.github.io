# Candidate Tracker

I built this in advance of the 2016 Iowa caucuses, and if you follow the link you'll see it was resurrected for the 2020 caucuses. Editors at the Des Moines Register wanted an easy way to compile and list visits by candidates for president, as well as a way to quickly tally who had been to the state the most. There is an accompanying admin tool for inputting visits that was built as a WordPress plugin — the Register at the time hosted all of its caucuses content in a separate site built with WP — and this was originally output by that smae plugin, but I ported it over to a stand-alone app when the WP site was discontinued.
