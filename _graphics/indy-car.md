# Indy Racing

Opened in 2006, the Iowa Speedway is billed as the fastest short track on the planet. The Indy Racing League has staged the Iowa Corn Indy 250 there since 2007, when Dario Franchitti edged out Mario Andretti at the finish line. The illustrations for this page leading up to that initial race were just fun to build, and I learned more about open-wheel racing than I'd ever wanted to know.
