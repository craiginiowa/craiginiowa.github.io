# How Ethanol Is Made

A pretty straight forward news graphic, the kind of thing I was hired to do. I hitched a ride to Wall Lake, Iowa, with a reporter and toured an ethanol plant, took loads of pictures, and leaned on our good friend Google images to produce this step-by-step graphic of one of Iowa's most important industries. I ended up repurposing a lot of the models I build for this in other graphics over the years.
