# Recycling Changes in Lexington

I'm pretty sure this is the graphic that got me the job at the Des Moines Register. The truck and the recycling bin are vector illustrations done in Illustror, or possibly FreeHand (which I preferred before Adobe acquired Macromedia and deep-sized FH). The sorting line was done in Cinema 4D, my 3-d software of choice. (Pretty much all the 3-d work you'll see in my portfolio was done with C4D.)

This was the first info graphic I'd done that really _looked_ like an info graphic. Like if you Googled "info graphic", this is the sort of thing that would have come up at the time. It ran on page 1 of the Herald-Leader and went straight to the top of my portfolio. It may not look like much now, but I was pretty proud of this one back then.
