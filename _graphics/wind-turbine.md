# Wind Turbines

If you ever drive through Iowa, one of the things you'll notice, beyond the miles and miles of corn and soybeans, are occasional forests of these towering white wind turbines. Wind turbines now account for more than 40 percent of the state's generated electricity, and as they first started to pop up, I created this graphic to go with a story about them. I like the detail of using the state capitol building, something every Iowan is familar with, to give a sense of scale to how big the towers really are.
