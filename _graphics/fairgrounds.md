# Iowa State Fairgrounds

The annual state fair is kind of a big deal in Iowa. It gets made fun of a lot, but it draws well over a million people over it's 10-day run every year. I know I never miss it. This was a fairly ambitious project. I traipsed all over those fairgrounds taking reference photos and stitched together Google map satellite images to use as a source for tracing all those roads and sidewalks onto my ground texture map.

It wouldn't be inaccurate to say I kind of rue the day I had the idea to do this. Every year I have to go into the file and update it with whatever improvements the fair has made. To see what I mean, I've included the first version and the 2019 version of the illustration. Changes include removal of the track, new gates, the new Equestrian Center and the completely redesigned grounds behide the Varied Industries Building. What's more, there were a few changes for 2019 that didn't make it into the update simply because I technically no longer work the the Des Moines Register, so this isn't technically my responsibility any more. But since I built it and I have the original files, it's still up to me to update it.

Not only that, it seems that after I left, the Register struck up a deal with the fair to use this map in an official capacity. It was a bit of a shock to turn aroud after buying my corndog a couple of years ago and see my map on a 6-foot-hight billboard on the fairgrounds. (Kind of cool, too. Don't tell anyone I said so.) So I guess I'll keep doing updates until Mac OS X updates finally make it impossible to run my ancient copy of the 3-d software used to create it. See ya at the fair.
