# Headline

In contrast to the other recycling graphic I'm showing off here, this one was a quickie. But I include it to show that a news graphic doesn't always have to be super elaborate to get it's point across. This presents the information in an easy-to-read, linear fashion without a lot of bells and whistles. I'd say the truck and the front-end loader took the longest to draw. And peep those blurb markers â€” tiny little recyling bins. A guy has to have _little_ fun.
