# Water Pollution

Water pollution is a major problem in Iowa. I don't have any graphic technique to show off here or anything, although I do like how this turned out. Mostly I just want to say that I grew up fishing in rivers and ponds in Iowa and hunting for frogs and crayfish in tiny creeks, and I'm sad that that's disappearing.
