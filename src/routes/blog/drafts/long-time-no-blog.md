_"I'm hoping the inclusion of a blog will get me to work on it a bit more."_

That's a line from my first blog post. The first of a whopping total of three. Oh, sure, I started with the best of intentions. I was going to do a minimum of one post per month. Just the forced repetition would make me a better writer, a more productive writer.

So what happened?

I guess I just don't have much to say. Just look at my Twitter account. It's mostly retweets or me reacting to the latest Iowa State football or basketball game. Let's face it, I'm a lurker.

So what's the occasion for this missive? Another quote from that first post:

_"Generally the thing that motivates me to work on a personal website is the prospect of looking for a new job [or] I fear Iâ€™m in danger of being downsized."_

Fear of losing your job has become a constant in the newspaper business, particularly when the economy is in a funk, as has been the case since the advent of the COVID pandemic. So in the interest of staying ahead of the game, here's an update to the ol' personal website. Nothing major, just a few new examples under [/developer/](/developer/) and a downloadable [resume](/assets/craig_johnson.pdf).

## Additions under /developer/

- **[Border Wall](/developer/border-wall/)** - The project that landed me a position on the Storytelling Studio at Gannett.
- **[Cincinnati Neighborhoods](/developer/cincinnati-neighborhoods/)** - An easy to scan data app looking at statistics for Cincinnati neighborhoods.
- **[Graphic Novel Editor](/developer/graphic-novel-editor/)** - My stab at a drag-and-drop editor for online graphic novels.
- **[In Depth Editor](/developer/in-depth-editor/)** - The flagship product for the Storytelling Studio.
- **[Parkersburg Tornado](/developer/parkersburg-tornado/)** - Probably the pinnacle of what I accomplished with Flash in my news artist days.
- **[Podcasts Landing Page](/developer/podcasts-landing-page/)** - A good example of the meat and potatoes work I do for Gannett.
- **[Rainfall Lookup](/developer/rainfall-lookup/)** - We do a lot of data lookups. Here's one.
- **[Virtual Senior Night](/developer/virtual-senior-night/)** - An example of how we repurpose prior work for something new.

## What's next?

I did enjoy writing the post about [animating a logo with Svelte](/blog/animated-site-logo), so maybe another how-to is in order. I'm kind of toying with the idea of rebuilding the website in Svelte Kit. Not only would it be a great way to learn Svelte Kit, but it would open up the possibility of adding a bit more interactivity to the site since I'd be able to publish Svelte components right here within the pages and posts. In particular, there are a couple of things I did in Flash back in the day that I'd like to try to recreate with Svelte.

Stay tuned.
