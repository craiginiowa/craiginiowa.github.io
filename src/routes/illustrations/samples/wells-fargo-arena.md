# Wells Fargo Arena

This was the first big project I tackled when I landed at the Des Moines Register. The arena was part of a complex that includes a convention center — Hy-Vee Hall — and the already existing Veterans Auditorium. Wells Fargo is home to a minor league hockey team — at the time affiliated with the Dallas Stars, then with the Minnesota Wild — and an NBA G Leauge team then affiliated with the Minnesota Timberwolves. It also hosts the high school state girls and boys basketball tournaments and wrestling tornament and has NCAA men's basketball tournament games, not to mention multiple concerts over the years.

As a graphic artist, this was the kind of thing I liked to work on, which you'll see if you look at the [graphics](/graphics) section of my work. This one was particularly tricky because it's built on a hill with several levels to it, so I had to model the terrain to correcly line up with doors on different levels for the fly-around video.
