# Climate Change

The Des Moines Register produced a large infographic about the looming threat of climate change (back when there was a shot at doing something about it). This is the art for the graphic (minus all the pesky text boxes and charts that obscure my pretty picture üòÅ) showing various causes and impacts of climate change.

I didn't often use 3D software for illustrations that weren't architectural or schematic in nature, but I had a lot of the pieces in this one already built for other projects ‚Äî the downtown Des Moines buildings, the tractor, the semi-trailer truck, the houses ‚Äî so it was easy to compose this. Most of the work was creating the texture maps for the lanscape. Still not happy with those trees.
