# Virtual Senior Night

If you played sports in high school or you're a parent of a kid who did so, you're familiar with the post-season tradition of Senior Night, when the team, coaches and parents all come together, usually for a pot-luck or catered dinner, to honor the departing seniors with speeches and awards. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic put a pause on all that, and just like kids had to go to school online, we helped the Greenville News in South Carolina recognize seniors from a wide range of sports with this online treatment. It was adapted from a similar "wall" component I built for an Arizona Republic story compiling [details on police shootings](https://www.azcentral.com/in-depth/news/local/arizona-investigations/2019/06/19/arizona-phoenix-police-shootings-officers-record-levels/3029860002/).
