[Svelte App](/developer/projects/svelte-app)

This is a page with live code on it, placed there via iframe.

Dev work on the code is done using [local-web-server](https://github.com/lwsjs/local-web-server) to serve the code from it's project directory.

`$ ws --directory /code/test`

As it is simply static files, the code can also be developed elsewhere, say in a `svelte` project, and copied to the `/code` directory, or served from an external url.
