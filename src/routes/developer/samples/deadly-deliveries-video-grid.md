# Video Grid

As part of an investigation into maternal death rates in the United States, USA Today interviewed women who had experienced complications related to childbirth. Because of the sensitive nature of these videos, we wanted a way to display them apart from our usual video gallery component and all of its analytics tracking. I transcoded the videos in Handbrake and served them up in this grid built as a web component using the Polymer library â€” the standard for all Gannett Digital projects at the time. I've since rebuilt it using Svelte, our go-to javascript framework for building self-contained interactive pages. Check it out at the link below.
