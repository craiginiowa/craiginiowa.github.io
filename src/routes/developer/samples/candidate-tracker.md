# Candidate Tracker

I built this in advance of the 2016 Iowa caucuses. Editors at the Des Moines Register wanted an easy way to compile and list visits by candidates for president, as well as a way to quickly tally who had been to the state the most. There was an accompanying admin page for inputting visits that I built as a WordPress plugin — the Register at the time hosted all of its caucuses content in a separate site built with WP — and this was originally output by that same plugin, but I ported it over to a stand-alone app when the WP site was discontinued. Eventually, the whole thing has been shutdown because of security concerns with the WP site. I subsequently built [this](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/storytelling/iowa-candidate-tracker/) for Gannett as part of the Storytelling Studio team. It was an adaptation of another project, and I didn't really like it at first, but I think it turned out OK. What remains to be seen at this writing is whether Iowa holds onto it's first-in-the-nation status. Not looking good.
