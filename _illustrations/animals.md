# Animal of the Week

When I worked at the Lexington Herald-Leader, we had a feature where we'd run a drawing of an animal every week. I don't even remember the particulars of where, why and for what reason. All I remember is the three graphic artists took turns and I ejoyed it because if forced me to work out my drawing muscles, something I don't do enough.

I do wish this was bigger. I saved this scan for a previous version of my portfolio website when download speeds were much slower and screen resolutions much smaller. I think I still have the originals socked away somewhere, but I'm far too lazy to rescan them.
