# Iowa Caucuses

The presidential caucuses are a source of pride for the state of Iowa (or at least were until 2020) and something the Des Moines Register puts a lot of effort into covering. The caucuses are also very complicated, at least on the Democratic Party side. It's more than just voting for your favorite. It's a whole production of preference groups and candidate viability and realignment. For Republicans, it's much simpler, basically a secret ballot. These illustrations were part of an news graphic describing how it all worked.

I mentioned in the description for the climate change illustration how I like to reuse elements I've done for other projects â€” I created the high school gym for a 3-point-shooting basketball game I built in Flash. Maybe someday I'll try rebuilding that game with vanilla javascript since Flash has rightly gone the way of floppy drives and SCSI ports.
