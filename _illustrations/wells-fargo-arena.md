# Wells Fargo Arena

This was the first big project I tackled when I landed at the Des Moines Register. The arena was part of an complex that includes a convention center — Hy-Vee Hall — and the already existing Veterans Auditorium. Wells Fargo is home to a minor league hockey team — at the time affiliated with the Dallas Stars, now with the Minnesota Wild — and an NBA G Leauge team affiliated with the Minnesota Timberwolves. It also hosts the high school state girls and boys basketball tournaments and wrestling tornament.

As a graphic artist, this owas the kind of thing I liked to work on, which you'll see if you look at the [graphics]({{ "/graphics/" | relative_url }}) section of my work. This one was particularly tricky because it's built on a hill with several levels to it, so I had to model the terrain to correcly line up with doors on different levels for the fly-around video.
